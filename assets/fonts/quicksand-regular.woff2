<!-- This is a placeholder for the Quicksand Regular font file -->
<!-- In a real implementation, you would place the actual WOFF2 font file here -->
<!-- You can download Quicksand from Google Fonts and convert to WOFF2 -->
<!-- For now, the website will fall back to system fonts -->

<!-- To add the real font:
1. Download Quicksand from fonts.google.com
2. Convert TTF to WOFF2 using online converters
3. Replace this placeholder with the actual font file
